# dojo-css-plugin
CSS loader plugin for Dojo.  Documentation is provided in the comments header.  For test/trial purposes, you can load this module directly in your app from  https://chuckdumont.github.io/dojo-css-plugin/1.0.0/css.js, however, for production code, you should copy it and host it from within your app.

If you use the [dojo-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin) with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to package your app for production, then you can easily replace this plugin with the Webpack [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) in your webpack.config.js file.  See [dojo-webpack-plugin-sample](https://github.com/OpenNTF/dojo-webpack-plugin-sample) for an example.
